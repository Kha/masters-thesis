\section{Background}
In this section, we give a basic introduction to our source and target
languages. We will discuss finer semantic details where needed in
\autoref{sec:trans} and \autoref{sec:mutref}.

\subsection{Rust}

Rust~\cite{matsakis2014rust} is a modern, multi-paradigm systems programming language sponsored
by Mozilla Research. Rust is still a quite young language, with its first stable
version having been released on May 15, 2015. The two biggest Rust project as of
this writing are the Servo\footnote{\url{https://github.com/servo/servo}}~\cite{anderson2016engineering} web browser engine and
the Rust compiler \texttt{rustc}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/rust-lang/rust}} itself.
