\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

During our verification work, we always focused on supporting just enough of the vast Rust
language as needed and instructed the translation tool to only translate the
relevant definitions. Still, in order to give a more representative picture of
our coverage of the language, we also had the tool translate as many definitions
from the \verb!core! crate as possible. This was followed by many iterations of
fixing edges cases in the translation where it produced invalid Lean code, which
overall resulted in a much more robust implementation.

The end result is a single file of 75694 lines of valid Lean code, which
is about 42\% longer than the entire Lean standard library combined.
It takes 76 seconds to parse and translate the Rust input and 29 seconds for
Lean to type check it. With 6731
definitions, the file contains about 45\% of all definitions in \rust{core}; see
\autoref{tab:eval} for a detailed breakdown of the missing definitions. While we
cannot guarantee the semantic correctness of the successfully translated
definitions, we believe that the type correctness is a significant indicator
for total correctness.

  \caption{Tabulated translation results per each definition from the
    \rust{core} crate. Only the first error per definition is recorded.
    Curiously some supposed niche cases like variadic functions and casting from
    function pointers to integral numbers are prominently represented, but it
    turns out that in both cases, these are almost exclusively automatically
    generated trait implementations up to a certain function arity.}
